</p>

<p>
prevailing thoughts of the modern go community and interested scholars
have been:
</p>
<ol>
<li>That the game is unlikely to be as old as the myths of Yao suggest,</li>

</ol>
<p>
and its presence in these tales reflects the caprices and biases of
Han historians.
</p>

<p>
That its actual invention occurred at some point during the
star-worshiping Zhou period or soon thereafter, leading to the board
and stones’ association with both the ‘Sky’ and ‘Time.’
</p>
<ol>
<li>From this, it has generally been thought, especially in the West,</li>

</ol>
<p>
that there has always been a ‘spiritual aura’ surrounding the game
because playing it seems to bring about moral and mental development
as the players are brought into harmony with the forces of yin and
yang in the universe.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Just about that time a revolution was initiated by a young provincial
lord, that leads a major turning point in the history of Japan. His
name was Oda Nobunaga. He was born of one of minor feudal lords in a
province of Owari ( Nagoya city nowadays and the surrounding
neighborhood ). A long period of ineffectual government of Ashikaga
clan extended for more than one hundred years. He had a strong desire
to become the absolute ruler of Japan, and built up his invincible
army. Hostile operations and military subjugation were repeated, and
finally, Nobunaga succeeded in capturing Kyoto in 1568, and instituted
his powerful military regime. After a lapse of ten years, Nobunaga's
provisional government established its rule over the central area of
Japan, and still his troops were marching east and west. Gradually,
Sansa came to give full play to his talent and gained a great
reputation as the strongest go player. Soon hearing that, Nobunaga
felt much interested and received Sansa to watch his game. Nobunaga
were full of curiosity about novelties and marvels like a child. He
liked go and had much confidence in his own ability to play go. He
tested Sansa by himself, and consequently he couldn't help admiring
Sansa's exquisite skill. He praised Sansa as the most valuable expert,
"Meijin". Since then, people called him Meijin.  I would like to make
a few more remarks about Nobunaga and the state of affairs in those
days. In 1569, Nobunaga gave an interview to a missionary, Luis Flois,
who wrote about Nobunaga in his report to Rome. The following is his
words.
</p>
<ul>
<li>His castle, Azuchi is a noble, magnificently gorgeous gold foiled castle tower. He</li>

</ul>
<p>
is thirty-seven years old. He is tall and lean, and having thin
mustache&#x2026;He displays pride and haughtiness, and doesn't hide his
contempt for the kings and the lords. He hates Buddhism, Shintoism and
worship of any idols, and doesn't believe paganism and divination. He
has no hesitation in saying that there is not either the creator of
the universe or the life beyond death, and boldly denied the
immortality of the soul.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobunaga had a great contempt for conventionality</li>

</ul>


<p>
In 1603 Tokugawa Ieyasu was inaugurated the shogun, but Hideyoshi's
son was unseated. When Tokugawa shogunate government started
functioning, Sansa was installed the first chief of the bureau of go
education, and his vested rights were ratified formally by the new
government. The office was called Go dokoro, and Go dokoro meant the
chairman's office. Go dokoro was to be involved all go matters.  In
1612, seven experts, chief among Sansa's friends and students, were
employed as committees under Go dokoro to establish the state go
academy. The government decided to grant stipends and samurai status
to them.  When Sansa was dying, he told Doseki to succeed to his
post. He raised up Doseki's rank to his own, and made all the young
pupils swear to follow the new teacher.  This second head of the
academy, Doseki was Sansa's first and illustrious pupil.  Today
comparing with Sansa's games and Doseki's, we clearly think that he
excelled his teacher

The machine may play chess badly, like a beginning amateur, but the
machine is not guilty. Man is guilty. He has not yet succeeded in
teaching the machine, in transferring his experience to it&#x2026;

To write a finished program, one must master both chess and the art of
programming.

<p>
Man solves inexact problems by relying on his accumulated
experience and on intuition. The following method for creating an
exact program for the solution of inexact tasks therefore suggests
itself: the program must be modeled on human thought
processes&#x2026; It seems to me the only real way.

We say that a bad plan is better than no plan, at least in human chess. If you have a plan and it fails, you learn something. If you act aimlessly, from move to move, from decision to decision, whether in politics or business or chess, you don’t learn and will never become anything more than a skillful improviser.
